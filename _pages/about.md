Hi there! I'm a PhD student of [Information Retrieval Lab](https://ir.sdu.edu.cn/index_en.htm) at Shandong University, supervised by Prof. [Jun Ma](https://ir.sdu.edu.cn/~junma/~junma_en.htm), Prof. [Pengjie Ren](https://pengjieren.github.io/) and Prof. [Xin Xin](https://xinxin-me.github.io/). I also work closely with Prof. [Zhaochun Ren](https://renzhaochun.github.io/) and Prof. [Mengqi Zhang](https://zm7.github.io/).
My research interest is mainly recommender system and large language model. 

Email address: jiyuan.yang at mail.sdu.edu.cn

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
